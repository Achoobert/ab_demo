# AppBuilder: Open Source No-Code Platform

Welcome to the **AppBuilder** repository! This project showcases an open-source, no-code database and UI builder designed as an alternative to CRMs such as Salesforce. It allows users to define data structures, create interactive UIs, and build dynamic web applications‚Äîall without writing code.

## About AppBuilder
AppBuilder empowers users to:
- Define **Objects** (tables) to store structured data.
- Create **Queries** to filter and retrieve data dynamically.
- Build **DataCollections** (user-facing objects) that adapt to user scope and UI selections.
- Design **UI Elements** such as pages, popups, grids, forms, and export options (PDF, Word, CSV).
- Deploy applications without complex backend setup.

AppBuilder is actively used in multiple production environments!

## üìÇ What's in This Repository?
This repository provides everything needed to explore AppBuilder, including:
- **Example JSON setup** to create a demo 'movie' app.
- **Cypress tests** for automated testing.
- **Docker Compose configuration** to deploy AppBuilder in production mode.
- **GitHub Actions workflow (`run.yml`)** as an example of how to set up the environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/) (for Cypress tests)

### Running the Demo
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/achoobert/ab_demo.git
   cd appbuilder-demo
   ```
2. Start AppBuilder using Docker Compose:
   ```sh
   mv .env.example .env
   docker compose up -d
   cd ./defs && ./upload.sh
   ```
3. Access AppBuilder in your browser at `http://localhost:8080` (or the configured port).

### Running Cypress Tests

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm run start_ab
   npm run setup_definitions
   ```
2. Run the Cypress tests:
   ```sh
