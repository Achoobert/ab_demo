# AppBuilder: Open Source No-Code Platform

Welcome to the **AppBuilder** repository! This project showcases an open-source, no-code database and UI builder designed as an alternative to CRMs such as Salesforce. 
It allows users to define data structures, create interactive UIs, and build dynamic web applications‚Äîall without writing code.

## About AppBuilder
AppBuilder empowers users to:
- Define **Objects** (tables) to store structured data.
- Create **Queries** to [filter](https://digi-serve.github.io/appbuilder_docs/user/concepts/filters/Filters.html) and retrieve data dynamically.
- Build **DataCollections** (user-facing objects) that adapt to user scope and UI selections.
- Design **UI Elements** such as pages, popups, grids, forms, and [export options (PDF, Word, CSV)](https://digi-serve.github.io/appbuilder_docs/user/cars_module/new%20child/Add%20Child.html)
- Deploy your applications without complex backend setup.
- Share **Modules**: all applications can be easily exported or imported*

*Imported modules are like a spreadsheet with all the formulas-- data is not included.   
[Example, initial setup of our Children at Risk AFTER module is imported](https://digi-serve.github.io/appbuilder_docs/user/cars_module/initial_setup/Initial%20Setup.html)

AppBuilder is actively used in multiple production environments!

## üìÇ What's in This Repository?
This repository provides everything needed to explore AppBuilder, including:
- **Example JSON setup** to create a demo 'movie' app.
- **Cypress tests** for automated testing.
- **Docker Compose configuration** to deploy AppBuilder in production mode.
- **GitHub Actions workflow (`docker-compose.yml`)** as an example of how to set up the environment.
